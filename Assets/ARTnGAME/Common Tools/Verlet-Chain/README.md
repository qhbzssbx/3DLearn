## About <a name = "about"></a>

A chain/rope simulation in Unity using Verlet integration instead of rigidbodies and constraints.

Uses GPU Instancing to draw the chain links from a single GameObject script.

Inspired by [jongallant's 2D version](https://github.com/jongallant/Unity-Verlet-Rope)

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

Git clone the project and open the Sample Scene to see the use.

Rope - Empty gameObject with the Rope script and Line Renderer (untick to turn off)

Click once to place the start point, click again to place the end point.

Follow how that is done in the source to understand how to place any chain at any 1 or 2 points in space.
