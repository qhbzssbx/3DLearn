// Smooth Voronoi - avoiding aliasing, by replacing the usual min() function, which is
// discontinuous, with a smooth version. That can help preventing some aliasing, and also
// provides with more artistic control of the final procedural textures/models.

// I've not seen anybody out there computing correct cell interior distances for Voronoi
// patterns yet. That's why they cannot shade the cell interior correctly, and why you've
// never seen cell boundaries rendered correctly. 
//
// However, here's how you do mathematically correct distances (note the equidistant and non
// degenerated grey isolines inside the cells) and hence edges (in yellow):
